  <h2>About Alejandro</h2>
  <p>  I am a native of Texas but, have lived in the peach state for about 20 years now. I wouldn't mind a change in scenery as long as its not back in the desert. I am a movie and anime lover, my friends and family would call me a geek when it comes to those things. I am trying to learn as much as I can of this world, that would include traveling, learning new ways of life and some history. I also enjoy anything that keeps me active, sometimes its the gym, other times its a hike or a swim in the lake.</p>
  <p>  I am loving Thinkful for the opportunity to immerse myself into the world of coding. I would ultimately love to work as a software engineer that is able to work from homw and go into the office. I am excited to see what all I will be able to provide for my future employeers and coworkers.</p>
